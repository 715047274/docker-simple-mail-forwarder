a very simple and easy to setup email forward service based on docker cloud.

docker-simple-mail-forwarder project home - https://github.com/zixia/docker/simple-mail-forwarder

## Who will need this docker
if you have a domain name, let's say: cool-domain.com. and you want your own email address from this domain, let's say: cool-user@cool-domain.com, maybe some friends else, but not many. what will you do?

some dns provider provide free email forwarding service, for their customers. some not. and some email forwarding service is not free.

then you need this docker: simple mail forwarder. deploy this docker online, set your email address and the forward address, get the docker's ip(or domain name from service), set your domain mx record to docker's ip(domain), you are set.

## Test
- docker rm smf > /dev/null 2>&1 ; docker run -ti --rm --name smf -v `pwd`:/docker --entrypoint /bin/bash zixia/simple-mail-forwarder sh
