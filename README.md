Github Issue - https://github.com/zixia/docker-simple-mail-forwarder/issues

Quick Start (TL;DR)
-------------------
Just set `SMF_CONFIG` and run:
```bash
$ export SMF_CONFIG='testi@testo.com:test@test.com:test'
$ docker run -p 25:25 zixia/simple-mail-forwarder
```
> Don't forget to modify the DNS MX record of your domain. (in this example, it's _testi.com_)

See? There is nothing easier. 

Quick Test
----------
```bash
$ telnet 127.0.0.1 25
> 220 testo.com ESMTP
ehlo test.com
> 250-testo.com
> 250-STARTTLS
> 250-AUTH PLAIN LOGIN
auth plain
> 334
dGVzdGlAdGVzdG8uY29tAHRlc3RpQHRlc3RvLmNvbQB0ZXN0
> 235 2.7.0 Authentication successful
quit
> 221 2.0.0 Bye
> Connection closed by foreign host
```
> "dGVzdGlAdGVzdG8uY29tAHRlc3RpQHRlc3RvLmNvbQB0ZXN0"  
> stands for  
> <pre>"testi@testo.com\0testi@testo.com\0test"</pre>,  
> which is base64 encoded.

You are set! :-]


Who need this docker
--------------------
if you have a domain name, let's say: cool-domain.com. and you want your own email address from this domain, let's say: cool-user@cool-domain.com, maybe some friends else. you need a simplest way to host your domain for email address. what will you do?

some dns provider provide free email forwarding service, for their customers. some not. and some email forwarding service is not free.

then you need this docker: simple mail forwarder. deploy this docker online, set your email address and the forward address, get the docker's ip(or domain name from service), set your domain mx record to docker's ip(domain), you are set.

I was about to pay for xxx (xx) but the cheapest plan is $10 per 10 mails/month. Having a $5 USD machine with unlimited mail&domains/month is an amazing idea!

Environment Variables and Defaults
----------------------------------
* `SMF_CONFIG`
    * MUST be defined. no default setting.  
* `SMF_DOMAIN`
    * Optional. 
    * Default: Domain from user email address.
    * Affect the following settings:
        * Hostname
        * Mailname
        * SMTP Greeting
        * Mail Header
        * etc.

###`SMF_CONFIG` Examples
Here's how to config the only environment parameter of SMF Docker:

####1. Basic
Forward all email received by testi@testo.com, to test@test.com:
```bash
$ export SMF_CONFIG='testi@testo.com:test@test.com'
```
> You could get the ESMTP AUTH password for your on your docker log. It's random generated.

####2. Advanced
Add ESMTP AUTH password:
```bash
$ export SMF_CONFIG='from@testi.com:to@testo.com:ThisIsPassword'
```
> Password will print on the docker log.

####3. Hardcore
Add as many email as you want. Seperated by semicolons or newline:
```bash
$ export SMF_CONFIG='testi@testo.com:test@test.com:ThisIsPassword;testo@testi.com:test@test.com:AnotherPassword'
```
> Tips: if you only provide the first password, and omit followings, then the passwords of all users will be the same as the password last seen. This is a feature.
